# BitlyQuickly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ollie/bitly_quickly.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ollie/bitly_quickly)

There are many great [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) gems, it's just that I wanted something as fast and as simple as possible.
It can only shorten URLs. :-)

It uses [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus) which is an awesome HTTP library for fast
and parallel networking. It also uses [Oj](https://github.com/ohler55/oj) which is a fast JSON parser.
